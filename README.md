# Markdown

This is a basic Markdown parser. It implements the
[CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) spec and supports all standard blocks. It
does not resolve inline content at the moment; all inline content is rendered
as-is.

The implementation is rough around the edges and leaves much to be desired, but
it is not likely that it will be cleaned up any time soon. This project was more
of an exercise to see if it could be done than an attempt to make a
production-ready parser.
